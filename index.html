  Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the social visibility of brands, paving the way for more incisive approaches towards marketing. 


 
The huge potential of AI in social media has led to Markets and Markets forecasting that the industry of deep learning, machine learning and NLP within sales marketing, customer experience management and predictive risk assessment within social platforms will grow to more than $2.1 billion in value by 2023. 

The rise of AI has been well documented, but how exactly can it enhance your social media marketing strategies? Let’s take a deeper look into the role that AI is set to play in boosting our exposure on social platforms.
The definition of AI varies depending on who you ask. But the chart above illustrates its value to various organisations. With as much as 84% of businesses believing that AI will aid them in obtaining a competitive advantage over rivals, the potential of the technology is clear. 


 
While artificial intelligence is still greeted with an air of mystique among many, the technology is all around us, no matter where we are or what we do. If we’re looking for customer support on a website, there will probably be a chatbot that will direct your message to a relevant department. Our smartphones, for instance, have dozens of applications and features that are powered by AI, such as voice assistants and GPS-powered navigation systems. 

Entertainment services like Netflix and Amazon Prime also utilize the capabilities of AI to provide bespoke recommendations for users. Elsewhere, Gmail has started utilizing AI to anticipate what you’re about to say when writing emails. 


Machine learning is a driving force behind the impressive voracity of AI. It’s a subset that allows machines to make intelligent predictions based on heavy levels of data. AI tools are entirely capable of automatically reviewing the accuracy of their predictions and improving on them over time. 

This useful facet of AI technology means that tools can actively improve of their own accord, without the need for human interjection. This means that their respective performance levels can noticeably increase as time goes on. 


 
Marketing software that you utilize today, whether it relates to PPC advertising or analytics or content, can be made more intelligent through the blend of AI and machine learning.

Such tools can be developed to recognize individual behaviors, preferences, ideologies and interests in order to deliver fully personalized experiences. They can potentially recognize where users have been, where they’re likely to be going, what they’ve typed in emails and what they’re previously asked Google Home. AI also has the potential to recognize the groups that target audiences belong and what physical stores they commonly visit, among other advanced applications. 

Artificial intelligence can take on these innumerable levels of data to make accurate predictions about the products that people intend to buy next to what advertising campaigns could be most effective to run. 

Essentially, AI deals in making smart predictions. It’s these predictions that can make all the difference in getting ahead of competitors in social media marketing. Let’s take a look at some of the ways in which AI-driven data science is working on revolutionizing the social visibility of brands.

Artificial Intelligence has already been pinpointed by the majority of marketers as the single most important trend set to influence the field of user experience over the coming five years. 

AI opens the door for social media marketers to get unprecedented access to their audiences and better understand their preferences and behaviour. This can yield hyper-targeted advertising campaigns that can appeal directly to the interests of targeted users. 

Tools like Finteza identify which pages do users view coming from social media networks, enabling marketers and website owners determine which social networks to focus on. 

This can help build appealing and engaging content much more efficiently.
